## Step 1:
1. Build and start the server.
2. Connect to the database.
3. Complete the `createTask` handler for the `POST` method.

### Lessons learned:
1. Don't make the start more complex by immediately restructuring folders.
2. First, work in a single file.
3. Complete one handler first (`createTask`); then you can start structuring.

## Step 2:
1. Structuring the `CreateTask` first.
2. Yes, it's not easy. See what has been done.
3. For `GetAllTasks` we need two things:
    i. fetching data from the database 
    ii. need an HTTP route that returns JSON
